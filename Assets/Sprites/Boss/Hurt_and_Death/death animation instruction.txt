1. Play Soup_Start from Attack Pattern 2 under Despair

2. Loop Soup_Brooding WHILE Despair moves erratically (randomly and quickly play animations from this array: Hurt_Left, Hurt_Right, Hurt_Down_, Hurt_Up, Pump_Right(attack02), Pump_Left(attack02),Idle_Down, Idle_Left, Idle_Right, Idle_Up, Move_Down, Move_Up, Move_Left, Move_Right)
WHILE Despair's moving sprite is slowly disappearing into the ground.

You can go wild with Unity effects here, too, sometimes much too much is exactly right.

Despair will want to talk to Liam one last time before she finally has dissolved, so stretch this sequence as long as 
necessary

3. Once Despair's Sprite is completely gone, play Soup_End(Attack Pattern 02)
